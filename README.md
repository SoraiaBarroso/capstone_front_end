## Introduction
This project is the capstone project for a series of 9 courses in a professional certificate program by Meta focused on front-end development.

This project showcases the culmination of these skills in a responsive web application that features a restaurant.

## Features

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **React**
- **Figma** (for wireframing and mockups)
- **UX/UI Design**

## Wireframes and Mockups
The design process began with creating a wireframe in Figma, which laid the foundation for the layout and structure of the application, Components such as buttons were designed and variants were created to ensure consistency.
